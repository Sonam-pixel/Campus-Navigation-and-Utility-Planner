# Campus Navigation & Utility Planner  
A Data Structures Project (BST, AVL, Graph Algorithms, Expression Trees)

This project implements a complete set of data structure operations used in a campus navigation and utility management system.  
The code is written in simple, easy-to-understand Python, suitable for students and beginners.

## Features Included

### 1. Building ADT  
A simple class storing:
- Building ID  
- Building Name  
- Campus Location  

---

### 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)  
Implemented with:
- Insert  
- Inorder Traversal  
- Preorder Traversal  
- Postorder Traversal  
- Height Calculation  

Used to store campus buildings in sorted order.

---

### 3. AVL Tree (Self-Balancing BST)  
Supports:
- Insert  
- Automatic balancing using rotations  
- LL, RR, LR, RL cases  

Ensures minimum tree height for efficient searching.

---

### 4. Graph Operations  
Graph is represented using an adjacency list.

Includes:
- BFS (Breadth-first search)  
- DFS (Depth-first search)  
- Add node  
- Add edge  

Used to represent building connections on a campus map.

### 5. Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
Finds the shortest path between two buildings based on weighted distances.

---

### 6. Kruskal’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)  
Finds the lowest-cost connection across all buildings, useful for network or cable layout.

---

### 7. Expression Tree  
Builds and evaluates arithmetic expressions using postfix notation.  
Used to calculate examples such as:
- Energy bills  
- Utility costs  
- Custom mathematical formulas
